        <p>The Worker Fatality Database collects data on work-related fatal injuries in the United States from multiple public sources. RAD collaborated with the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (NCOSH Network) to develop <a href="http://www.coshnetwork.org/fatality-database-report" target="_blank">a web-based public submission process</a>, available in English and Spanish, to gather information about cases of work-related fatal injuries to add to the database and a set of database administration tools to allow NCOSH Network staff to manage the database with greater ease.</p>
        <p>In July 2014 the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice launched the first-ever Media, Communications and Technology Lab (CommsLabs) in Bogotá, Colombia as part of the LGBT Global Development Partnership with USAID. Gathering together more than 35 activists from Latin America with 12 technologists and communications practitioners from around the world, the group worked together to create new media strategies and digital advocacy tools specifically designed to meet the needs of LGBT human rights defenders.</p>
        <p>RAD has worked with Astraea, Astraea grantee partners and network to collaboratively design and implement CommsLabs in Kenya (2015) and South Africa (2016). Each 5-day event brought together together 35 activists from a diversity of organizations in Kenya and South Africa and 15 trainers to support participants in movement building and applied-skill sharing in Communications Strategy, Media Making, Healing Justice, Web Making, and Holistic Security.</p>
